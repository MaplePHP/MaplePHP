# MaplePHP - Layered structure MVC PHP framework

## MaplePHP is currently in beta, and significant changes are expected.

**MaplePHP is a layered structure MVC PHP framework** that very user-friendly and does not compromise on performance or scalability. By leveraging a modular architecture and with full PSR support, the framework allows for easy customization and flexibility, enabling developers to pick and choose the specific components they need to build their applications.

## Why Choose MaplePHP?
MaplePHP is designed with a commitment to **independence** and adherence to best practices, implementing **PHP Standards Recommendations (PSR)**. Within the framework, you'll find a variety of excellent libraries, including query, cache, logger, and more. However, we don't impose them on you. Feel free to utilize familiar third-party libraries or extend MaplePHP's functionality with your own. In our philosophy, dependencies should be at your discretion, not dictated by the framework.

Our library architecture is unique â€“ each library within MaplePHP is self-contained or, in some instances, relies on another MaplePHP library. This approach not only ensures that you can initiate projects without external dependencies but also allows for an efficient use of resources. By avoiding redundancy, the framework steers clear of becoming bloated. 

Updates to MaplePHP are delivered through minor and patch versions, ensuring smooth project updates without breaking changes. This compatibility extends to PHP 8 and potentially beyond. With MaplePHP, you have the flexibility to shape the framework to meet your development needs without unnecessary constraints. Mening you will get all the latest functionality but you will never see Maple version 4 because you most likely already retired ;).

- **Dependency Flexibility:** Developers have the freedom to choose and control dependencies, ensuring that MaplePHP doesn't impose unnecessary constraints on project structures. 
- **Continuous Updates:** MaplePHP offers regular updates through minor and patch versions, allowing developers to stay current without worrying about breaking changes.
